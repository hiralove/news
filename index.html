<p>Addressing Sangat Darshan programme in Adampur assembly segment Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal said that his government is resolving all the pending issues created by the successive Congress governments at Centre.</p>

<p>Holding Congress responsible for meting out "grave injustice" to the state, Badal alleged the Congress party had deprived the state of its capital, Punjabi speaking areas and legitimate share of river waters.</p>

<p>"Even after making a promise to hand over capital to Punjab the Congress government had backtracked from it and deprived Punjab of Chandigarh", he added. With <a href="http://urbanpendu.org/cast-your-vote-which-party-will-win-punjab-election-2017-opinion-poll/">Punjab election 2017</a> nearby its evident that every party is pulling its socks and nobody has fall behind for defaming each other.</p>

<p>Slamming the Congress leaders for "misleading" the people on SYL canal issue, he said that his government had never supported the construction of the canal.</p>

<p>He said that they had flagged up these issues time and again with Union government and hoped that the NDA government would undo the grave injustice done to the state.</p>

<p>Badal said that Congress had made these issues so complicated that no time frame could be fixed for their resolution, but the state government was duty-bound to get all these issues resolved at the earliest.</p>
